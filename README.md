## ToUCH HC Teaching Modules

This repository hosts a collection of teaching modules covering a range of topics in Heterogeneous
Computing. The modules are primarily intended for undergraduate Computer Science and Computer
Engineering students. They were developed as part of the NSF-funded ToUCH project.

The following document gives an overview of the modules and discusses the guiding principles and the
motivation behind their design.

### Module Categories 

The modules are classified into five broads areas

* [Fundamentals](./Fundamentals)
* [Algorithms](./Algorithms)
* [Architecture](./Architecture)
* [Programming Models](./Programming)
* Performance

Modules in each category are located in their respective sub-directories
