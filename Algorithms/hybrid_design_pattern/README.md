## [B3] Hybrid Design Patterns 
Apan Qasem [\<apan@txstate.edu\>](apan@txstate.edu)
   
### Description 
The proliferation of heterogeneous compute platforms have given rise to new algorithmic design
paradigms. This modules provides an overview of seven collaborative design patterns for hybrid applications. 

* CPU-to-GPU (C2G)
* CPU-to-GPU Iterative (C2GI)
* CPU-and-GPU Iterative (C&GI)
* Workload Partition (WP)
* CPU-Producer-GPUConsumer (CPGC)
* GPU-Producer-CPU-Consumer (GPCC)
* CPU-GPU Pipelined (CGP)

### Context

This module requires that students have some basic knowledge of parallel computing and GPU
computing. As such it is ideally suited for an upper-level Parallel Programming course or an
advanced Algorithms course. A sophomore-level Algorithms course which provides coverage of
parallel algorithms, may also be suitable. 

### Topics 

* GPU Task Offloading [K]
* CPU-GPU collaborative execution [K]
* Hybrid algorithms [C]
* Heterogeneous parallel programming models [K]
* Data and task partitioning [C]
