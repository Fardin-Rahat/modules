## [B2] Algorithms for GPU Computing 
Apan Qasem [\<apan@txstate.edu\>](apan@txstate.edu)
   
### Description 
This module looks at the some of the most fundamental algorithms suitable for GPU offloading. 

* Radix Sort 
* Prefix Sum (Scan)
* Reduction 

The SIMD, and more specifically the SIMT, programming model is reviewed. This is followed by a
step-by-step walk-through of each of the above three algorithms. 

### Context

This modules is intended for a second or third-year Data Structures and Algorithms course. However,
it may also be integrated into more advanced courses such as Parallel Programming or Advanced
Algorithms. The module assumes very basic familiarity with GPU computing and OpenMP. If students
lack this exposure then a short review may be helpful. 


### Topics
